=== Example References
* `table_n.column_n` is a pattern that could match `Customers.Name` or `Orders.OrderID`.


== Startup & Run

[source]
mysqladmin -p status
        if needed:
            su to user which the db runs under

* `su mysql` open CLI.

=== Allow remote users to connect
* in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d` comment out `bind-address`.


=== View & Select DB
* `SHOW DATABASES;`  show available DBs.
* `USE <db-name>` open chosen DB.
* `SHOW TABLES;` show all tables


== Admin
===== Create User
[source,sql]
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.*
TO 'user'@'%'
IDENTIFIED BY '<pwd>'
WITH GRANT OPTION;


== Queries

=== Create
==== CREATE
[source,sql]
CREATE TABLE table_name (col_1 datatype, col_2 datatype);
CREATE TABLE Customers (CustomerID int, Name varchar(225);


==== INSERT
[source,sql]
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (literal_1, literal_2);
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES(1, 'Peter');
-- if using AUTO_INCREMENT
INSERT INTO Customers (NAME) VALUES ('Nancy');

Copy `<column>` from `<table-1>` to `<table-2>`.
[source,sql]
INSERT INTO <table-2> (<column>)SELECT <column>  FROM <table-1>;





=== Read
Reading is done with the `SELECT FROM WHERE` query.



* `SELECT * FROM <table>;` show all table entries
* `SELECT <column> FROM <table>;`

==== WHERE
[source,sql]
WHERE x LIKE wildcard;
WHERE x IS NULL;
WHERE x IS NOT NULL;

===== Wildcards
[options=header,cols="<,<,<"]
|===
|Symbol |Description|Example
|%|0..n chars| bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
|_| 	Represents a single character 	|h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
|[]| 	Represents any single character within the brackets |	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
|^| 	Represents any character not in the brackets 	|h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
|-| 	Represents a range of characters 	|c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
|===


=== Update
==== UPDATE
Set all values in `column` to `value`
[source,sql]
UPDATE table SET table.column = value;

Copy values from other table.
[source,sql]
UPDATE table_1 SET table_1.column_1 = table_2.column_2
FROM table_1
JOIN table_2
ON table_1.column_0 = table_2.column_0;


=== Delete
* Delete
[source,sql]
DELETE
FROM PLUGINSTATE
WHERE PLUGINKEY LIKE '%languages%'

* Delete DB <br>
`DROP DATABASE guacamole_db;`
* Delete User <br>
`DROP USER 'foo'@'localhost';`

=== Join

==== Inner Join
Selects records that have matching values in both tables.
[source, sql]
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.Item
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;


==== Left Join

[source,sql]
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

==== Right Join
Same as left join, but with swapped positions. Exists only for completeness.

[source,sql]
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

==== Full Join
all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

[source, sql]
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

=== With

[source,sql]
WITH temporary_name AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM table_name)
AND temp_name_2 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM table_name)
SELECT *
FROM temporary_name
WHERE column_name operator value;

|===
|data type|literal|description
